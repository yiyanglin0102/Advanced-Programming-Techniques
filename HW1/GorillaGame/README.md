## Getting Started

Start executing java codes in Main.java - main() file.

## Folder Structure

The workspace is structured in the follwing:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
    - `Main.java`: the app starts from this file, creating the characters that players would like to create and passing numbers to indicate each specific gorilla.
    - `GameStart.java`: After passing number of indication of specific gorilla, the constructor build the object class.
    - `Character.java`: A parent class of 3 different sub-gorilla classes, creating polymorphism and being inherited.
        - `Mountain_Gorilla.java`
        - `North_Gorilla.java`
        - `Long_Arm_Gorilla.java`

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
